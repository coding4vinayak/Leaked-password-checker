# Lead Password Checker

Lead Password Checker is a tool designed to validate and check the strength of passwords according to specified security criteria. This project aims to help individuals and organizations ensure their passwords meet security standards, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Features

- **Password Strength Validation**: Checks password strength against various criteria, including length, complexity, and usage of special characters.
- **Blacklist Checking**: Validates passwords against a list of commonly used or compromised passwords to avoid easily guessable passwords.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides instant feedback to users about the strength of their passwords.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows for setting custom password rules based on organizational needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the Lead Password Checker:

   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```

2. Enter a password when prompted, and the checker will analyze the strength and provide feedback.

### Command-Line Options

- `--min-length`: Set the minimum length of the password.
- `--require-special`: Enforce the usage of special characters.
- `--blacklist`: Use a custom blacklist file for checking commonly used passwords.

Example:

```bash
python password_checker.py --min-length 12 --require-special
```

### Configuration

You can modify the `config.py` file to change the default settings, such as minimum password length, required character sets, and blacklist file paths.
